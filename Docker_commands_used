# Docker Commands Cheat Sheet

This README contains basic Docker commands I used while learning Docker on Linux.

---

## Installation

Install Docker on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

Check Docker service status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

Add your user to the docker group to run docker without sudo:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

---

## Working with Containers

List running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

List all containers (including stopped ones):

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Run the official hello-world image:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

Build a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory:

```bash
docker build -t firstimage .
```

Run a container from your custom image:

```bash
docker run firstimage
```

Run a container in detached mode and map ports:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 firstimage
```

View logs of a container:

```bash
docker logs <container_id>
```

Attach to a running container:

```bash
docker attach <container_id>
```

Stop a running container:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

---

## Notes

- Replace `<container_id>` with the actual ID or name of your container.
- Use `docker --help` to see more options and commands.
