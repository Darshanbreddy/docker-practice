# Docker Practice Projects

## Description

This repository contains my practice projects completed by following along with a YouTube tutorial on Docker. The tutorial is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bSbNNH4Nqw&t=7334s), and throughout this repo, youâ€™ll find the various Docker-based projects that I completed, along with screenshots as proof of my work.

These projects are intended to help me learn and gain hands-on experience with Docker and containerization.

## Projects Completed

The following projects were completed during the course of the tutorial:

1. **Basic Docker Setup**  
   - Setting up Docker on the local machine.
   - Creating a Dockerfile and containerizing a simple application.

2. **Docker Compose**  
   - Using Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.
   - Working with environments and network configurations.

3. **Docker Networking**  
   - Setting up and managing networks for Docker containers.
   - Linking containers using network bridges.

4. **Docker Volumes**  
   - Managing persistent data with Docker volumes.
   - Configuring volume mounts for container data storage.

5. **Multi-Stage Builds**  
   - Using multi-stage builds to optimize Dockerfile images for production.

Each project folder includes:

- Dockerfiles
- Configuration files
- Scripts

## Screenshots

You can find the screenshots of my work scattered throughout this repository. They serve as proof of progress as I followed the tutorial.

Here are the screenshots available in the root directory:
